# My AGI Learning Journey

This is my personal space to track my attempts to understand **Artificial General Intelligence** — mostly by myself, with no formal training, no team, no funding, just curiosity and stubbornness.

I’m learning:
- What AGI actually means (and whether it’s even possible)
- The math and theory behind it
- The tools, models, and frameworks that might get us there
- The ethical, philosophical, and societal implications

This repo is my journal, my notes, my experiments — and maybe, someday, my roadmap.

## What I’m Doing Right Now

- 📖 Reading books and papers on machine learning
- 💻 Playing with LLMs, RL, and other AI tools
- 🧠 Trying to understand how minds work (neuroscience, cognitive science)
- 🧭 Building my own mental model of “what AGI would look like”
